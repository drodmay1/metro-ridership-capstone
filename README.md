# ðŸš‡ DC Metro Rail Ridership Trends (2019â€“2024)  
**by David Rodriguez-Mayorquin**

## Overview
This project explores daily ridership data from the Washington, DC Metro Rail system from 2019 through 2024. The goal is to analyze how ridership was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate changes in rider behavior over time.

## Project Goals
- Visualize ridership trends by year, month, and weekday
- Compare pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic ridership patterns
- Build a simple model to forecast ridership trends
- Summarize insights for transit planning and recovery analysis

## Data Source
Data collected from WMATAâ€™s Ridership Portal:  
ðŸ”— [WMATA Ridership Portal](https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/ridership-portal/)

Only Metro Rail data was used (Metrobus excluded).

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Excel (for initial exploration)
- Overleaf / LaTeX for report writing

## Advanced Analysis: Predictive Modeling

To explore future ridership trends, I trained and evaluated four machine learning models using features derived from the Metrorail ridership dataset:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

### Features Used
- Year
- Month
- Day of Week
- Is Weekend
- Is Holiday

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio. Models were evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² (coefficient of determination)**.

### Results Summary

| Model                  | MSE           | RÂ² Score |
|------------------------|---------------|----------|
| Linear Regression      | 52,116,658,235 | -4.2185  |
| Random Forest Regressor| 1,951,757,714  | 0.9507   |
| Support Vector Regressor| 3,532,779,314 | 0.8982   |
| Gradient Boosting      | 4,983,145,736  | 0.8740   |

Random Forest achieved the best performance in terms of both accuracy and generalization.
